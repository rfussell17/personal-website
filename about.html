    <h3>ABOUT</h3>
    <p id="intro">
      I’m Robin. A self-taught programmer from Kelowna, BC. I fell in love with
      coding in 2018 after dabbling in a few small projects and have spent
      nearly every single day learning or building since then. I’m a creator at
      heart. A musician, culinary wizard, gamer, sports enthusiast and now a
      lifelong student of programming. I started getting my feet wet building a
      few pages and websites, after I dove into the basics I started creating
      small web apps and games to further my learning through trial and error. I
      love programming because I can combine so many of my passions into
      something real. Learning is something that has always been my biggest
      passion. Whether It’s learning an instrument, how to cook challenging
      dishes, refining my abilities in a sport, or how to dominate strategy
      games. I’ve put together my portfolio with projects in mind that include a
      good range of skills and technologies, and showcase what I have learned.
