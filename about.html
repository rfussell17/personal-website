      <p id="intro">
        I’m Robin. A self-taught programmer from Kelowna, BC. I fell in love with
        coding in 2018 after dabbling in a few small projects and have spent
        nearly every single day learning or building since then.
        <br></br>
        I’m a creator at heart. A musician, culinary wizard, gamer, sports enthusiast and now a
        lifelong student of programming. I started getting my feet wet building a
        few pages and websites, after I dove into the basics I started creating
        small web apps and games to further my learning through trial and error. I
        love programming because I can combine so many of my passions into
        something real. Learning is something that has always been my biggest
        passion.
        <br></br>
        Whether It’s learning an instrument, how to cook challenging
        dishes, refining my abilities in a sport, or how to dominate strategy
        games. I've been building a wide array of projects using several different technologies
        to learn as much as possible in the last 18 months, and I’ve put together my portfolio with projects in mind
        that include a
        good range of skills and technologies, to showcase what I have learned.
      </p>
      <p>
        My skills currently include full-stack web app / software development, JS, HTML, CSS, Java, ReactJS,
        Bootstrap, jQuery, Github and version control.
