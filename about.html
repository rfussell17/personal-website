  <p id="intro">
    I’m Robin. A self-taught programmer from Kelowna, BC. I fell in love with
    coding in 2018 after dabbling in a few small projects and have spent
    nearly every single day learning or building since then.
    <br></br>
    I’m a creator at heart. A musician, culinary wizard, gamer, sports enthusiast and now a
    lifelong student of programming. I started getting my feet wet building a
    few pages and websites, after I dove into the basics I started creating
    small web apps and games to further my learning through trial and error. I
    love programming because I can combine so many of my passions into
    something real. Learning is something that has always been my biggest
    passion.
    <br></br>
    Whether It’s learning an instrument, how to cook challenging
    dishes, refining my abilities in a sport, or how to dominate strategy
    games. I’ve put together my portfolio with projects in mind that include a
    good range of skills and technologies, and showcase what I have learned.
